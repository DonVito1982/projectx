Rails 4.2 to 5.0: Setup Dev Environment,"There is always some overhead setting up our development environments.

It might be useful to have a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to work on this project. ",1
Rails 4.2 to 5.0: Create a `Gemfile.next`,"# Current

There is only one `Gemfile` in the project.

# Expected

We want to create a `Gemfile.next` so that we can start targeting a new set of dependencies based on the next version of Rails (5.0)

## Resources

For this we can use something like `ten_years_rails` -- See instructions here: https://fastruby.io/upgrade#6",5

Rails 4.2 to 5.0: Start using `params: { id: 123 }` in controller specs,"# Current

Positional arguments are deprecated:

```
DEPRECATION WARNING: Using positional arguments in functional tests has been deprecated,
         in favor of keyword arguments, and will be removed in Rails 5.1.
```

# Expected

Start using `params` in controller specs.

Rails 4.2 to 5.0: Add ApplicationRecord to app/models,"# Background

We will need an app/models/application_record.rb:

```
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true
end
```

The only class that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base will be ApplicationRecord.

# Current

All models in app/models do not extend `ApplicationRecord`

# Expected

All models in app/models should extend `ApplicationRecord`

Rails 4.2 to 5.0: Change belongs_to associations to be optional when not required,"# Background

Make sure that all `belongs_to` associations look like this:

```
belongs_to :user, optional: true
```

The only exception will be if the `belongs_to` already says `required: true` as an option.

# Current

Some references to `belongs_to` don't explicitly mention that the relationship is optional.

# Expected

Explicitly define `optional: true` for all `belongs_to` associations which are not required.

# References

Rails 4.2 to 5.0: `bundle install` using Rails 5.0,"# Current

Bumping the version to rails 5.0 will probably fail with the current set of dependencies.

# Expected

Add conditionals to `Gemfile` so that we can start bundling with the next version of Rails.

## Exit criteria

`bundle install` should work with rails version 5.0",8
